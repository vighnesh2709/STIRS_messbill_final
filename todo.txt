one will be used to calculate the number of times hes come to the mess
so that would ideally be number of days he has come multiplied by the value

and the second would be the leave thingi which i need to sort out

and the last would be the full table i need to display for that month



to be able to do this, my google sheets needs to look difference, 
i need to have one sheet for one month and the in that sheet it will have columns

id , name ,times scanned,days come


here days come would just be for that day even if he scans once days come will get incrememnted
and the times scanned will increment everytime he comes 


only the times scanned should get incremented so that we need to somehow fix on the node mcu code 

so the hardware part would be a little complex to do somehow i need to sort that out now
